Developed by the [Trace Center](http://trace.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin at Madison

Included are EZ Access demos that can be used to learn how to make EZ Access pages for various kiosk applications, and to show how EZ Access can transform a web-based kiosk to be accessible.

The demos included will (eventually) be a train station ticket kiosk and an airport check-in kiosk.
